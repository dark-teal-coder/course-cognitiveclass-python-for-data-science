# Cognitive Class Python for Data Science

## Repository Description

This repository contains the code for the online course "Python for Data Science" provided by [Cognitive Class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses). The course is structured into modules. In each module, there are some video lessons, some Jupyter labs held in cloud and some review questions at the end. There is also a final exam at the end of the course. Some code does not work properly in the cloud environment as they might need additional settings that will be difficult for beginners to understand. Therefore, the edited version of those Jupyter notebooks, with additional explanations added, and answers to the review questions and the final exam are provided here.
